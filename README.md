Hi, I’m Jordan, an AI/ML Engineer and AWS Cloud Engineer specializing in building production-grade AI systems, including LLM applications, multimodal assistants, RAG pipelines, and fine-tuned models deployed at scale. I focus on transforming complex requirements into fast, reliable, and user-ready AI solutions.

My background in AWS supporting high-severity, production-down enterprise environments has shaped the way I engineer systems, with an emphasis on scalability, observability, and operational excellence.
